the description isn't that important for search engines, but it's important for the user. Because he can learn
a little bit about your website just by reading the description. So try to be short and straight to the point in your
description

Also it's important for people with desabilities, this descriptions help them to understand what the image and your content are about.

4) Headings - Use h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 tags

5) a. Use trustful links inside your site, if your mentioning something from another website, make sure it's a good source
   b. Avoid using unnamed links, for example: "domain.com/37dghf38kd9efe8". Something like this would be better: "domain.com/subdomain"
